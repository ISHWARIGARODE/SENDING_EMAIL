This project demonstrates how to send emails automatically using Python. It uses the smtplib and email libraries to connect with an SMTP server (like Gmail), compose an email with a subject and message body, and send it to one or more recipients. This can be used for tasks like sending notifications, alerts, or even automated reports.
